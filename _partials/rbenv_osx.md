## Installing Ruby (with [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv))

First we need to clean up any previous Ruby installation you might have:

```bash
rvm implode && sudo rm -rf ~/.rvm
# If you got "zsh: command not found: rvm", carry on. It means `rvm` is not
# on your computer, that's what we want!

sudo rm -rf $HOME/.rbenv /usr/local/rbenv /opt/rbenv /usr/local/opt/rbenv
```

Now let's get [`rbenv`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and [`ruby-build`](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build) packages from Homebrew, they'll be useful.

```bash
brew uninstall --force rbenv ruby-build
```

Then quit **all your opened terminal windows** (Cmd + Q) and restart one. Then run:

```bash
brew install rbenv
```

Again, quit all your terminal windows and restart.
