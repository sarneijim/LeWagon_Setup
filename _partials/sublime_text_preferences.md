### Preferences

We need to set some default on Sublime Text. Sharing defaults within your
colleagues, fellow students and teachers is important: it eases the process
of getting help or helping other.

1. Open Sublime Text
1. Go to `Preferences > Settings - Users`
1. Erase all the content of the file which got opened.
1. Copy paste the code below.
1. Save the file

```json
{
  "tab_size": 2,
  "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
  "detect_indentation": false,
  "ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save": true,
  "trim_automatic_white_space": true,
  "trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true,
  "draw_white_space": true,
  "use_tab_stops": true,
  "hot_exit": false,
  "remember_open_files": false,
  "highlight_modified_tabs": true,
  "rulers": [ 80 ],
  "wordWrap": false,
  "folder_exclude_patterns": [ "tmp", "log", ".git", "_site", ".bundle", ".sass-cache", "build" ]
}
```

The convention we are enforcing with this configuration is that we use 2 spaces
for indentation (no tabs). So each time you will hit the `tab` key,
Sublime Text will insert 2 spaces.

You can now quit Sublime Text.
