### Package control

We will install the package manager right away, you'll need this to install addons. Launch Sublime Text, and open the console via the `View > Show Console` menu. This will show a prompt at the bottom of Sublime Text window where you can type stuff. You need to [copy some code](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation#st2) and paste it in that Sublime Text console. Then hit `Enter`. Restart Sublime Text (`Ctrl` + `q` is a handy shortcut to quit the application since the close button in top corner of the window will only close the current window and **not** quit Sublime Text).

If you have trouble with this step, ask a teacher. This was the only time we use the sublime text prompt. All other commands will be in the Terminal.

To check that the Package Control is installed, you can hit `Ctrl`+`â‡§`+`P`, and type `installp`. If you see something like below, you're good to go!
