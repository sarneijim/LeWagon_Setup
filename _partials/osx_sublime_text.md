## Sublime Text 3 - Your text editor

A text editor is one of the most important tools of a developer. Go to [this page](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) and download **Sublime Text 3** for OS X. Install it (double click the downloaded file and drag & drop the app **into** the `Applications` folder, **don't skip this**). If you had Sublime Text 2 installed before, please uninstall it (by dragging/dropping it to the Trash).

Sublime Text is free without any time limitation but a popup will appear every ten saves to remind you there is a license to buy. You can hit `Esc` when this happens, but feel free to buy Sublime Text if you really like this one (there are alternatives).

Again, make sure that Sublime Text is there, not in the disk image you downloaded. To make sure it's correct, once Sublime Text is installed, unmount the "Sublime Text 3" disk in the left panel of Finder. Finder will complain if something went wrong. Ask a teacher.
