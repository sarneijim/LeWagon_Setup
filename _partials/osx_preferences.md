## Keyboard

As you become a programer, you'll understand that leaving the keyboard takes a lot of time,
so you'll want to minimize using the trackpad or the mouse. Here are a few tricks on OSX
to help you do that:

### Keyboard speed

Go to  > System Preferences > Keyboard. Set `Key Repeat` to the fastest position (to the right) and
`Delay Until Repeat` to the shortest position (to the right).

### Full Keyboard Access

Go to  > System Preferences > Keyboard. Click on the third tab (Shortcuts). At the bottom of the
pane, click the radio button `All controls`. This way when you get a dialog with several options,
you'll be able to type `Enter` to confirm, or `Space` to choose the cancel option. If you have more than
two options, you can use tab to circle between them.

### macOS For hackers

[Read this script](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos) and cherry-pick some stuff you think will suit you.
For instance, you can type in the terminal this one:

```bash
# Expanding the save panel by default
defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSNavPanelExpandedStateForSaveMode -bool true
defaults write NSGlobalDomain PMPrintingExpandedStateForPrint -bool true
defaults write NSGlobalDomain PMPrintingExpandedStateForPrint2 -bool true

# Save screenshots to the Desktop (or elsewhere)
defaults write com.apple.screencapture location -string "${HOME}/Desktop"

# etc..
```
