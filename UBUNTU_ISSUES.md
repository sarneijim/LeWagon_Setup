Here are some tracks to solve issues when installing Ubuntu:

## No Devices choice at reboot

Make sure Windows FastBoot is disabled and restart in **Advanced Mode**.

## No OS choice at reboot

Disable Windows FastBoot **&** Bios FastBoot (see below).

**OR**

Access the Bios and change Boot option **ONE by ONE** <=> choose an option, save, reboot, if your problem persists, come back to default Boot option, choose another option and move on.

## Disable Bios FastBoot

1. Restart your machine in default mode and keep pushing on <kbd>F2</kbd> or <kbd>F11</kbd> or <kbd>Suppr.</kbd> to access the Bios.
2. Look for the boot options to disable the Bios FastBoot
